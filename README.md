# MinePy
MinePy is a collection of Python 3 modules that mining, civil, and geological engineers may find useful.

The end-goal is to have a large, versatile, and portable library of useful modules.

I am working on this admittdly niche project in my free-time, so it will likely progress slowly. I am somewhat inexperienced in programming, so I welcome any comments, suggestions, feedback, etc.
